    <h2>Chilaquiles Rojos Recipe</h2>
    <p>Chilaquiles rojos was one of my favorite comfort foods growing up. This recipe with chicken is more like a casserole than the traditional chilaquiles. Great for a potluck or party and you'll get lots of compliments from your guests! It can be made hot or mild depending upon your heat tolerances or preferences.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large white onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 dash roasted ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 dash dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>   
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x15-inch casserole dish.</li>   
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Combine drained tomatoes and chipotle chiles in adobo in a blender; puree until smooth.</li>   
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has softened, about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in garlic until fragrant; add pureed tomato-chile sauce and simmer until mixture starts to thicken. Pour in chicken broth and stir in cumin, oregano, and salt; let simmer until mixture thickens. Remove from heat.</li>   
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Mix tortilla chips and tomato-chile sauce, folding carefully to cover chips completely. You may have to do this in 2 batches.</li>   
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong>: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>   
    </ol>
